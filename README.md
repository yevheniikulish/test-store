There's a store with simple home page, products page
with product categories, actually products and pagination.
It is possible to add a few products to cart in a profile
with personal info. You can register and log into your
account and then place your order and pay for it by stripe.
When you finish your order, you can review it in orders tab.
After all, you can log out.

I used Python, Django 3, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery to create
this site.
